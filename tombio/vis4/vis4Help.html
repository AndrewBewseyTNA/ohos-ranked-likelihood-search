<h2>The <i>Full taxon details</i> visualisation (vis4)</h2>
<p>
    This visualisation is a fast way to explore the taxonomic
    knowledge-base for any given species. It displays
    all information including character state values, images and text
    files side-by-side for a species selected from a drop-down list.
</p>
<p>
    To use the visualisation, just select a taxon from the drop-down
    <img src="##tombiopath##vis4/resources/dropdown.png" style="float: left; margin: 5px" />
    list. When you've done this, all information in the knowledge base for this taxon will
    be displayed, including the character state values, images (if any referenced) and any
    other information in referenced HTML files (if any referenced). An example is shown below.
</p>
<p>
    You can also tailor the display to exclude any of these three types of information
    (character state values, images or text) by unchecking the relevant check-boxes
    (also visible in the image below).
</p>
<p>
    See below for further information on how to use the
    image display control. The 'Popout' button below the image display allows you to
    create a free-standing resizable window containing the image display if you wish.
