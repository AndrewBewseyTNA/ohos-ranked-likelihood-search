<h2>Working with text files</h2>
<p>
    Knowledge-base authors can provide any number of text files (supplied as HTML files)
    to describe different aspects of any given taxa and link to these in their knowledge-base.
</p>
<p>
    If only a single text file is referenced, it is simply displayed as supplied. If more than one
    text file is supplied, then they are listed in a drop-down list above the text display area
    and you can switch between them by selecting the one you want to see.
