<h2>Working with image groups</h2>
<p>
    <img src="##tombiopath##common/pop-out-image.png" style="float: left; width: 250px" />
    If more than one image is specified for the taxon in the knowledge-base they can be
    displayed as a special image group where, you can change the image
    by clicking on another camera icon at the top of the image. The camera icons
    become visible - one for each available image - when you move your mouse cursor
    over the top of the image. Alternatively use the <b>left</b> and <b>right</b> arrows,
    visible when you move your mouse cursor to the left or right of the image, to move
    forward and backward through the image group. 
    You can <b>close an image</b> by clicking the cross in the top right of it.
</p>
<p>
    You can <b>zoom
    in and out</b> of the image by using your mouse wheel. When an image is zoomed in, you
    can <b>pan</b> it by dragging the image with your mouse.
</p>
<p>
    If your image group is shown in a separate window,
    you can make it bigger or smaller by dragging the bottom right corner
    of the window. Move the window around the screen by dragging with the mouse. (If
    the window is zoomed in, dragging the mouse pans the image rather than dragging
    the window in which case you should drag  the window's caption bar.)
    If you have a lot of image windows open and you want to close them all at once, then
    right-click the mouse to see a context menu and select the <b>Close all images</b> item.
