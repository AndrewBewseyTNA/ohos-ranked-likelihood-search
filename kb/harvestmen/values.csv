SaddleShape,waisted,,"The saddle is pinched in at some point to make it look 'waisted'. For the purposes of this key, a pinch point only counts as a waist if it reduces the maximum width of the saddle by at least one third.

For the purposes of this key, a pinch point only counts as a waist if it reduces the maximum width of the saddle by at least one third. In other words, the width of saddle at the the pinched part must be no more than two-thirds the maximum width of the saddle. ",,
