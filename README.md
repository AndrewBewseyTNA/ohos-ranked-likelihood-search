# The Tom.bio ID Visualisation Framework
The Tom.bio ID Visualisation Framework for creating online 
taxonomic keys and visualisations. The genesis of the project 
was the Field Studies Council's (FSC) Tomorrow's Biodiversity 
project (project funded by Esmée Fairbairn). The Field
Studies Council is a UK-based environmental education
charity. We are committed to moving the project forward 
as an open-source collaborative venture.
